Welcome to the English we speak with me, Neil.

00:16.000 --> 00:17.440
And me, Fae-fe.

00:17.440 --> 00:21.680
Our expression is famous last words.

00:21.680 --> 00:27.680
We say this when we believe something someone says will soon be proven wrong.

00:27.760 --> 00:30.320
Have you ever said famous last words?

00:30.320 --> 00:32.560
Yes, I went to a party at the weekend.

00:32.560 --> 00:36.240
I told my friend that I never forget people's names.

00:36.240 --> 00:37.840
Famous last words.

00:37.840 --> 00:44.880
I was so embarrassed because immediately after saying that, I called my friends new boyfriend by the wrong name.

00:45.600 --> 00:46.640
Three times.

00:46.640 --> 00:49.040
Yes, famous last words.

00:49.040 --> 00:51.520
Could you give us another example in context?

00:51.520 --> 00:54.640
I went to a restaurant the other day and ordered a curry.

00:54.640 --> 00:57.760
The waiter warned me it was very hot.

00:57.760 --> 01:01.280
I said I love spicy food and nothing's too hot for me.

01:01.280 --> 01:02.640
Famous last words.

01:02.640 --> 01:05.040
What happened was it too spicy for you?

01:05.040 --> 01:07.920
Yes, I couldn't even finish one mouthful.

01:07.920 --> 01:10.480
I was sweating and nearly crying.

01:10.480 --> 01:12.320
It was so spicy.

01:12.320 --> 01:14.800
Let's hear some more examples of this expression.

01:18.480 --> 01:23.840
My grandfather says he never cries when he watches sad films.

01:24.080 --> 01:25.520
Famous last words.

01:26.400 --> 01:31.520
We watched a very sad film on the weekend and he cried a lot.

01:33.120 --> 01:37.040
I said my cricket team would win the championship this year.

01:37.760 --> 01:40.320
Famous last words. We finished last.

01:42.240 --> 01:45.600
Lay said he didn't need to study for his exam.

01:46.480 --> 01:49.920
Famous last words. He failed in the end.

01:50.000 --> 01:58.880
You're listening to the English we speak from BBC Learning English and we're learning the

01:58.880 --> 02:01.440
expression, Famous last words.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.840
Which is said when someone says something that they believe will happen,

02:05.840 --> 02:07.760
only to be proven wrong.

02:07.760 --> 02:11.920
Yes, we often say it when we think it will be quite embarrassing for the person

02:11.920 --> 02:14.560
when their statement is shown to be wrong.

02:14.560 --> 02:19.760
Like for example, when I told you I was brilliant at my favorite board game,

02:19.920 --> 02:21.760
and then you beat me easily.

02:21.760 --> 02:22.800
Really embarrassing.

02:22.800 --> 02:29.120
Yes, and we sometimes say it to ourselves to laugh at something we have said previously, don't we?

02:29.120 --> 02:34.320
That's right. It's a form of laughing at ourselves about something we believed or predicted,

02:34.320 --> 02:37.520
and then realize we're embarrassingly wrong.

02:38.160 --> 02:41.200
Like when I said England would win the football world cup.

02:41.200 --> 02:45.200
Famous last words. Do you think they'll win the next world cup?

02:45.200 --> 02:46.640
Of course, definitely.

02:47.200 --> 02:50.080
However, those could be Famous last words.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.080
Bye. Bye.
