Welcome to the English we speak with me, Neil.

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:17,440
And me, Fae-fe.

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,680
Our expression is famous last words.

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,680
We say this when we believe something someone says will soon be proven wrong.

8
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:30,320
Have you ever said famous last words?

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,560
Yes, I went to a party at the weekend.

10
00:00:32,560 --> 00:00:36,240
I told my friend that I never forget people's names.

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,840
Famous last words.

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:44,880
I was so embarrassed because immediately after saying that, I called my friends new boyfriend by the wrong name.

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,640
Three times.

14
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,040
Yes, famous last words.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,520
Could you give us another example in context?

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,640
I went to a restaurant the other day and ordered a curry.

17
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:57,760
The waiter warned me it was very hot.

18
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,280
I said I love spicy food and nothing's too hot for me.

19
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,640
Famous last words.

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,040
What happened was it too spicy for you?

21
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
Yes, I couldn't even finish one mouthful.

22
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,480
I was sweating and nearly crying.

23
00:01:10,480 --> 00:01:12,320
It was so spicy.

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:14,800
Let's hear some more examples of this expression.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,840
My grandfather says he never cries when he watches sad films.

26
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,520
Famous last words.

27
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,520
We watched a very sad film on the weekend and he cried a lot.

28
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:37,040
I said my cricket team would win the championship this year.

29
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,320
Famous last words. We finished last.

30
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,600
Lay said he didn't need to study for his exam.

31
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:49,920
Famous last words. He failed in the end.

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:58,880
You're listening to the English we speak from BBC Learning English and we're learning the

33
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,440
expression, Famous last words.

34
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:05,840
Which is said when someone says something that they believe will happen,

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,760
only to be proven wrong.

36
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:11,920
Yes, we often say it when we think it will be quite embarrassing for the person

37
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,560
when their statement is shown to be wrong.

38
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,760
Like for example, when I told you I was brilliant at my favorite board game,

39
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
and then you beat me easily.

40
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,800
Really embarrassing.

41
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:29,120
Yes, and we sometimes say it to ourselves to laugh at something we have said previously, don't we?

42
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:34,320
That's right. It's a form of laughing at ourselves about something we believed or predicted,

43
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:37,520
and then realize we're embarrassingly wrong.

44
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,200
Like when I said England would win the football world cup.

45
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:45,200
Famous last words. Do you think they'll win the next world cup?

46
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:46,640
Of course, definitely.

47
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,080
However, those could be Famous last words.

48
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,080
Bye. Bye.
